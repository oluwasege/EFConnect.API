# EFConnect.API
Creating a Social Media web API based on the Eleven Fifty Academy guide<br>

Built using instructions from https://eleven-fifty-academy.gitbook.io/dotnet-302-core/<br>

I plan to work on an upgraded version as some things can be improved<br>

My configurations are in the appsettings.Development.json which i git ignored, but i added the base template for the configurations i used and you can just add yours.
Thank you!
